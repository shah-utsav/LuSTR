I spent 8 weeks during the Summer of 2024 at the University of Maryland, College Park working in their Department of Aerospace Engineering on the Lunar Surface Technology Research (LuSTR) Project. I worked on developing a GUI to control a motor rotating at over 4800 rpm along with other things, which was a part of the project.
P.S. The complete program can not be revealed.
